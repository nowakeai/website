## Alpha Quality

`v0.1.0-alpha.1` is for technical evaluation in disposable or non-critical AWS environments.

It is not a drop-in AWS NAT Gateway SLA replacement.

## Platform Scope

Current alpha scope:

- AWS only,
- one AZ per HA group,
- Terraform provider first,
- cloud-init bootstrap instead of a published BetterNAT AMI,
- LoxiLB/eBPF datapath.

Not included:

- multi-cloud runtime,
- CloudFormation delivery,
- AWS Marketplace delivery,
- active-active NAT,
- active connection migration,
- published BetterNAT AMIs.

## Failover Semantics

BetterNAT targets recovery for new connections.

During failover:

- active flows may reset,
- packets may be dropped,
- new-flow recovery depends on HA profile, AWS API timing, and standby readiness,
- stable EIP mode converges back to the shared EIP for new flows,
- non-stable mode changes public source IP after failover.

Observed low-cost AWS tests saw about 12 seconds of client-visible outage for owner termination under test conditions. This is evidence, not an SLA.

## Cost Semantics

BetterNAT avoids NAT Gateway per-GB processing charges.

It does not eliminate:

- EC2 instance charges,
- EBS charges,
- EIP charges where applicable,
- public internet data transfer charges,
- DynamoDB charges,
- CloudWatch, SSM, and logging charges.

High-volume savings are workload dependent and modeled, not proven by expensive multi-TB benchmark runs in the alpha.

## Performance Semantics

Throughput depends on:

- EC2 instance type,
- packet size,
- connection churn,
- LoxiLB datapath behavior,
- security group connection tracking behavior,
- public internet egress limits,
- CPU and memory headroom.

Do not assume NAT Gateway-level scale from a small EC2 appliance.

## Bootstrap Semantics

The first alpha boot path depends on:

- package repositories,
- Docker install/start,
- LoxiLB image pull,
- artifact URL reachability,
- checksum verification,
- cloud-init execution.

Boot-to-ready timing is not representative of a future prebuilt AMI.

## Tuning Semantics

The alpha bootstrap applies conservative gateway sysctls.

Linux `nf_conntrack_max` is not the primary LoxiLB/eBPF conntrack capacity knob.

Advanced tuning such as conntrack buckets, timeouts, ephemeral port ranges, backlog, IRQ/RSS, and ENA settings is deferred until benchmark-backed profiles exist.
