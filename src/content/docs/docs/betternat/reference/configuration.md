## Terraform Provider Inputs

Use `betternat_aws_gateway` to deploy the AWS gateway stack.

Provider version is specified in Terraform/OpenTofu `required_providers`, not on the resource itself:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    betternat = {
      source  = "nowakeai/betternat"
      version = "= 0.2.0"
    }
  }
}
```

The gateway runtime version is separate from the provider version. Set
`betternat_version` to a supported BetterNAT release tag from the current Quick
Start or release notes. The provider derives the matching agent and CLI GitHub
Release artifact URLs and SHA256 checksums from its built-in release manifest.

OpenTofu can use the same `source = "nowakeai/betternat"` address now that
the provider is registered in the OpenTofu Registry.

### Required

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `name` | Gateway name. Used in resource names and HA group identity. |
| `region` | AWS region. |
| `vpc_id` | Target VPC ID. |
| `public_subnet_ids` | Map of AZ name to public subnet ID. |
| `private_route_table_ids` | Map of AZ name to private route table ID list. |
| `private_cidrs` | CIDRs allowed to use the gateway for SNAT. |

### Bootstrap

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `ami_id` | Explicit Linux AMI ID. Required for the `cloud_init` path. |
| `ami_channel` | Reserved AMI channel selector. Accepted values are `stable`, `candidate`, and `dev`, but BetterNAT does not currently resolve channels into public AMIs. Set `ami_id` directly. |
| `bootstrap_mode` | `cloud_init` by default. Use `cloud_init` for ordinary Linux AMIs that install BetterNAT at first boot. Use `prebaked_ami` only for BetterNAT AMIs that already contain Docker or the selected LoxiLB runtime, LoxiLB, `betternat`, `betternat-agent`, `loxicmd`, sysctl settings, and systemd units. |
| `associate_public_ip_address` | Optional advanced override for the launch template network interface public IPv4 setting. Leave unset for provider-derived behavior. |
| `betternat_version` | BetterNAT runtime release tag. The provider uses it with `instance_type` to derive agent/CLI bootstrap URLs and checksums. |
| `agent_binary_url` | Sensitive URL override for `betternat-agent`. Usually leave unset when `betternat_version` is set. |
| `agent_binary_sha256` | SHA256 checksum override for the agent artifact. Usually leave unset when `betternat_version` is set. |
| `cli_binary_url` | Sensitive URL override for the `betternat` CLI. Usually leave unset when `betternat_version` is set. |
| `cli_binary_sha256` | SHA256 checksum override for the CLI artifact. Usually leave unset when `betternat_version` is set. |
| `loxicmd_binary_url` | Optional URL for a host `loxicmd` binary. If empty, bootstrap installs a Docker wrapper. |
| `loxicmd_binary_sha256` | Optional checksum for `loxicmd_binary_url`. |

Launch templates created by the provider require IMDSv2 and set the metadata hop limit to `1`.

In `cloud_init` mode, gateway nodes launch in the configured public subnets with
auto-assigned public IPv4 enabled by default. That per-node public IPv4 is for
bootstrap and management/control-plane reachability: package repositories,
Docker image pull, GitHub release artifacts, SSM, and AWS APIs. It is separate
from `stable_egress_ip`, which controls whether BetterNAT also manages a shared
EIP as the public identity for private-subnet egress.

In `prebaked_ami` mode, user data only writes runtime config, applies the
baseline sysctl profile, and starts preinstalled services. With
`stable_egress_ip=true`, the provider disables per-node auto-assigned public
IPv4 because bootstrap downloads are not required and the shared EIP provides
the egress identity. With `stable_egress_ip=false`, per-node public IPv4 remains
enabled because the active gateway node's public IP is the egress identity.

Set `associate_public_ip_address` only when you deliberately want to override
that derived behavior. For example, a private VPC with NAT/VPC endpoints may set
it to `false` even in `cloud_init` mode. A troubleshooting environment may set
it to `true` even for a prebaked stable-EIP AMI.

### Capacity

| Name | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `instance_type` | `t3.small` | Gateway node instance type. The AWS supplemental fixture uses arm64 `t4g.small`. |
| `use_spot` | `false` | Use Spot instances. Good for disposable tests; be cautious for real egress. |
| `min_size` | `1` | ASG minimum size. |
| `desired_capacity` | `2` | ASG desired capacity. Use `2` for active/standby HA. |
| `max_size` | `3` | ASG maximum size. |

Capacity-only updates are intended to be in-place. Other topology or bootstrap changes may require replacement.

### Datapath

| Name | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `datapath_engine` | `loxilb` | BetterNAT node datapath. |

LoxiLB is the supported BetterNAT datapath. BetterNAT does not expose nftables
fallback behavior as a product path. LoxiLB has its own eBPF conntrack state;
Linux `nf_conntrack_max` is not the primary LoxiLB capacity knob.

### Egress Identity

| Name | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `stable_egress_ip` | `true` | If true, BetterNAT manages a shared EIP so new private-subnet egress flows converge back to the same public IP after failover. Gateway nodes may still have ordinary per-node public IPv4 addresses for bootstrap and management. If false, BetterNAT skips the shared EIP and the public source IP changes to the active instance's public IP after failover. |

### HA Timing

| Name | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ha_profile` | `default` | Timing profile. Use `default`. Legacy values `stable`, `balanced`, and `fast` are accepted as aliases for `default`. |
| `ha_lease_ttl_seconds` | profile default | Advanced override for lease TTL. |
| `ha_renew_interval_seconds` | profile default | Advanced override for renew interval. |

The default profile uses a 10 second lease TTL and a 1 second renew/check interval. Override the two advanced fields only when you need a deliberately different timing envelope.

### Observability

| Name | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `prometheus_enabled` | `true` | Expose Prometheus metrics from each node. |

Default metrics endpoint:

```text
http://<gateway-private-ip>:9108/metrics
```

### Route And Rollback

| Name | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `route_mode` | `replace_route` | Current AWS route failover mode. Currently supports `replace_route`. |
| `route_destination_cidr` | `0.0.0.0/0` | Destination route managed by BetterNAT. |
| `route_target_type` | `instance` | Current route target type. Currently supports `instance`. |
| `rollback_on_destroy` | `true` | Attempt to restore captured route targets during destroy. |
| `allow_destroy_without_rollback` | `false` | Allow destroy to proceed when rollback cannot be performed. Use carefully. |

Use the [Rollback Guide](/docs/betternat/operations/rollback/) before changing
rollback defaults in an existing VPC.

### Tags

| Name | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tags` | none | Additional tags applied to provider-managed AWS resources where supported. |

Tag changes require replacement because only capacity fields are updated in
place.

### Computed Outputs

These attributes are written by the provider and are useful for runbooks,
dashboards, and support:

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `lease_table_name` | Legacy lease table name for older environments. |
| `coordination_table_name` | Coordination table used for HA lease, agent registry, peer discovery, and handover records. |
| `managed_route_table_ids` | Flattened list of private route table IDs managed by BetterNAT. |
| `egress_public_ips` | Public egress IPs recorded by the provider. |
| `active_instance_ids` | Active gateway instance IDs by HA group or AZ. |
| `standby_instance_ids` | Standby gateway instance IDs by HA group or AZ. |
| `rollback_route_targets_json` | Captured previous route targets used during destroy rollback. |
| `control_plane_status_json` | Provider-recorded AWS control-plane status snapshot. |
| `status` | Provider status summary. |

Internal/sensitive computed values include `agent_config_json`,
`agent_config_hash`, `user_data`, `install_plan_json`, `peer_api_auth_token`,
and `provider_infrastructure_revision`. Treat them as provider state, not as
operator inputs.

## Provider Data Sources

Use `betternat_runtime_artifacts` to inspect the provider's built-in runtime
artifact manifest:

```hcl
data "betternat_runtime_artifacts" "current" {
  version = "v0.2.0"
  os      = "linux"
  arch    = "arm64"
}
```

Use `betternat_aws_gateway_status` for read-only AWS control-plane status when
you already have the provider-generated install plan:

```hcl
data "betternat_aws_gateway_status" "egress" {
  name              = betternat_aws_gateway.egress.name
  region            = betternat_aws_gateway.egress.region
  install_plan_json = betternat_aws_gateway.egress.install_plan_json
}
```

Use `betternat_gcp_gateway_status` for read-only GCP alpha Compute status:

```hcl
data "betternat_gcp_gateway_status" "egress" {
  name       = betternat_gcp_gateway.egress.name
  project_id = betternat_gcp_gateway.egress.project_id
  region     = betternat_gcp_gateway.egress.region
  zone       = betternat_gcp_gateway.egress.zone
  network    = betternat_gcp_gateway.egress.network
  subnetwork = betternat_gcp_gateway.egress.subnetwork
  client_tag = betternat_gcp_gateway.egress.client_tag
  route_name = betternat_gcp_gateway.egress.route_name
}
```

## GCP Resource

Prefer the `nowakeai/betternat/google` module for GCP installs. The
`betternat_gcp_gateway` resource is the lower-level provider primitive for
module authors and advanced validation workflows.

It manages provider-owned GCE forwarding gateways or a zonal MIG, LoxiLB
bootstrap, Firestore-backed agent HA when enabled, one tagged default route to
the active gateway, and optional stable public identity through an existing
regional static external IPv4 address.

Minimal shape:

```hcl
resource "betternat_gcp_gateway" "egress" {
  name       = "lab-egress"
  project_id = var.project_id
  region     = "us-west2"
  zone       = "us-west2-a"

  network    = google_compute_network.lab.name
  subnetwork = google_compute_subnetwork.lab.name
  client_tag = "lab-private-client"

  private_cidrs = ["10.91.0.0/24"]
}
```

Private client VMs must have the configured `client_tag` and no broader route
with a higher priority that bypasses the BetterNAT route.

Provider-rendered GCP agent HA bootstrap is available behind an explicit
switch:

```hcl
resource "betternat_gcp_gateway" "egress" {
  name       = "lab-egress"
  project_id = "shared-resources-alt"
  region     = "us-west2"
  zone       = "us-west2-a"

  network    = google_compute_network.lab.name
  subnetwork = google_compute_subnetwork.lab.name
  client_tag = "lab-private-client"

  private_cidrs = ["10.91.0.0/24"]

  enable_agent_ha                = true
  manage_firestore_database      = true
  firestore_database_id          = "(default)"
  firestore_location_id          = "us-west2"
  manage_runtime_service_account = true
  manage_runtime_iam             = true
  betternat_version              = "v0.2.0"
}
```

When `enable_agent_ha = true`, either set `service_account_email` explicitly or
set `manage_runtime_service_account = true` so the provider derives and creates
a runtime service account. The service account is attached to the gateway VMs
and must be granted enough access to read/write the Firestore gateway
coordination records, describe/delete/create the configured static route, read
route operation status, and read instance metadata. The provider renders
`agent_config_json`, `agent_config_hash`, `peer_api_auth_token`, runtime
artifact URLs/checksums, and `startup_script` for a Firestore-backed,
route-only agent HA smoke.
The required permission list is exposed as computed
`runtime_iam_permissions`; see [IAM Policy](/docs/betternat/security/iam-policy/#gcp-alpha-runtime-service-account).
Set `manage_runtime_iam = true` to let this resource create or update the
project-level BetterNAT runtime custom role and bind `service_account_email` to
it. The default custom role ID is derived from the gateway name and exposed as
`runtime_iam_role_id`. Leave it false when IAM is managed by a separate
Terraform stack or an infra-admin workflow.
Set `manage_firestore_database = true` only in disposable validation projects
where this resource should create and delete the Firestore Native database used
for HA coordination. Leave it false when the database is created by a platform
or infra-admin stack. `firestore_location_id` defaults to `region` when
database management is enabled.
Set `runtime_service_account_id` only when the derived service-account ID is not
acceptable for the project.
Set `capacity_repair_mode = "mig"` only for disposable GCP GA-readiness
validation. The default remains `unmanaged`; MIG mode creates a zonal instance
template and managed instance group so GCE can replace lost gateway capacity,
but live termination, failover, replacement, and cleanup evidence is still
required before this becomes the documented GCP default.
Explicit `agent_binary_url`, `agent_binary_sha256`, `cli_binary_url`, and
`cli_binary_sha256` overrides are supported for local mirrors and unreleased
test builds. This path is still experimental until live two-agent route
fencing, passive failover, proactive handover, LoxiLB-on-GCE, IAM, and cleanup
evidence are complete.

The rendered GCP agent config leaves `local.node_id = "auto"`. At runtime the
agent resolves that value from GCE metadata to the local instance name, which is
the same identifier used as the GCP static route `nextHopInstance` target.

Experimental GCP agent HA config uses Firestore coordination and route-only
public identity:

```yaml
cloud: gcp
region: us-west2
gcp:
  project_id: shared-resources-alt
  zone: us-west2-a
  network: lab-vpc
  client_tag: lab-private-client
  route_priority: 800
  firestore_database_id: betternat-test
ha:
  enabled: true
  lease:
    backend: firestore
    key: lab-egress-us-west2-a
  route_failover:
    mode: replace_route
    route_table_ids:
      - lab-egress-default-via-gateway
    destination_cidr: 0.0.0.0/0
    target_type: instance
  public_identity: {}
coordination:
  backend: firestore
```

For GCP, `route_table_ids` currently means GCP static route names. Existing
regional static external IPv4 address handover can be rendered with
`stable_public_identity_address_name` when `enable_agent_ha = true`. Live GCE
stable-IP activation, failover, and connectivity-first handover have been
validated. Before publishing a GCP-capable release, keep the release checklist
focused on Registry install verification and disposable smoke evidence rather
than reopening the GCP HA design. Provider-owned static-address lifecycle
management remains out of scope; pass an existing regional static external IPv4
address name. The gateway subnet must provide Private Google Access or an
equivalent private path to Google APIs before testing this mode; the agent may
need to call Compute and Firestore after its temporary external access config is
removed.

## Update Behavior

The provider updates only `min_size`, `desired_capacity`, and `max_size` in
place. Most other input changes require replacing the `betternat_aws_gateway`
resource.
Use the [Upgrade And Replacement Guide](/docs/betternat/operations/upgrade-and-replacement/)
before changing runtime, AMI, subnet, route, datapath, EIP, HA timing, tag, or
bootstrap fields.

`betternat_gcp_gateway` updates are intentionally not implemented in the first
alpha. Replace the resource to change GCP gateway topology.

## Runtime Config

Terraform renders `/etc/betternat/agent.json` onto each node.

Users normally should not edit this file by hand. If you do, restart:

```sh
systemctl restart betternat-agent.service
```

Then verify:

```sh
betternat doctor --live
```
